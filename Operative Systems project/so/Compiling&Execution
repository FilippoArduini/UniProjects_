Compiling and Running

Install dependencies: Make sure you have OpenSSL installed via Homebrew:
brew install openssl
Compile the code:
Use the compile command that includes the OpenSSL paths:

gcc server.c -o server -I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include -L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib -lcrypto
gcc client.c -o client
Run the server:
Start the server before the client:

./server
Run the client:
In another terminal, run the client passing the path to the file to process:

./client test.txt
Output:
The client will display the SHA-256 fingerprint of the file:

[CLIENT] SHA-256: <hash>
